This is a class allows you to use SQL Azure (or, with some modification of the database connection string, SQL Server) as a store for PHP session data. Usage details can be found in this blog post: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/silverlining/archive/2011/10/19/using-sql-azure-to-store-php-session-data.aspx. However, I've added logic that will create the table and stored procedure that are referenced in that post, so it is no longer necessary to create the table and stored procedure in advance (as stated in the post). You will, however, have to create the "SessionsDB" database in advance.
